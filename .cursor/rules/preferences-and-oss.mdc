# Team Preferences and OSS Decisions

- Communication & style
  - English‑only codebase, names, descriptions, README.
  - Prefer concise, high‑signal changes; pragmatic 20/80 improvements.
- Dependencies vs. forking
  - Use `splid-js` as a normal dependency (npm `splid-js@1.5.3`) rather than forking.
  - Attribute upstream in README; fork only if upstream changes are required and not accepted quickly.
- Secrets
  - Read from `.env` only; `CODE` contains the Splid invite code. Do not log secrets.
- Testing/Inspector
  - Local testing via MCP Inspector with Streamable HTTP at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (no proxy token required for server).
- Error handling
  - Prefer clear, actionable error messages over silent fallbacks.
  - Validation failures should be explicit (e.g., unknown names, share sums).
